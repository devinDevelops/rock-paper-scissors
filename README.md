Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with JavaScript

I'll be building a basic rock-papaer-scissors program using JavaScript. The player will be prompted for a choice between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will be the opponent, randomly selecting one of the options. This game will print in the console.
